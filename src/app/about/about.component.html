            <h6>My Programming Journey</h6>
            <hr>
            <p>
                After earning a BA in Communication in December 2012, I moved to Seattle, WA where I spent a few years
                working in sales and advertising. I was first introduced to coding, by chance, when some helpful
                coworkers showed me a few tricks I could use to automate my work tasks. My interest was sparked. If a
                few simple statements could have such an effect on my productivity, what else could I do with code?
                <br>
                <br>
                Eager for more, I began taking introductory programming courses at a local community college each day
                after work. My interest grew, and in 2015 I decided I wanted to pursue programming professionally. Over
                the next year, I worked to satisfy degree requirements, and was admitted to North Seattle Collegeâ€™s
                Application Development degree program, beginning in the fall of 2016. The program instilled CS
                concepts, emphasizing the application development process by focusing on three main areas: web, mobile,
                and cloud technologies. I completed my studies in May of 2018, earning a BAS in Application Development.

                During my time in school, I worked on various client projects coordinated by the degree program, and
                completed an internship with a small software company working on cost accounting integrations for
                Microsoft Dynamics GP. I was kept on as a developer when my internship completed, and in the summer of
                2018, I relocated to Taiwan with my husband, and continued with the same company remotely. In Taiwan, I
                began teaching high school computer science part-time, in addition to my remote work.
